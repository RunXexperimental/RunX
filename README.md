### What's this

This is just a website created by a newbie when he is suffering his design class homework.
####
Actually, he is not interested in this project at all.
####
Until he gets deeper â™‚ into it, he finds out it would be somehow interesting...
####
So, he decided to give it a try.
####

**********************************************

### How this thing was bulit

This thing was the lamest website you have ever seen.
####
It uses a standard html starter mold, so it's functions are s**t.
####
Even worse, due to the f**king Response speed, it might be a long time to wait for the pictures to render complete.
####
But the advantages are that each picture has the best quality so you can save them on your PC/ Linux /Mac/ "Something else".
####

**********************************************
### What's next?

We will keep uploading new pages... and fixing bugs of course.
